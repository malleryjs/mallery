Static documentation site generator

-------

This is a free and opensource static website generator for
project documentations. Mallery automatically creates a static documentation
website from the contents of your choosen folder. The output will look
similar to [this website](http://www.malleryjs.com).

## Features
- A slim and general purpose theme
- Flexible and responsive navigation
- History control (last visited pages)
- Previous & Next page buttons
- Several options for individualization
- The exported HTML of markdown files is extended with bootstrap annotation

## Ideas / Future plans
- Just work on the website and test Mallery
- Improving error handling
- Loadbar
- Non-webserver handling (open the html files locally without server)
- Enable minification of the js and css files (they are just called `min` :P)
- Serve mode: Add a CLI option which watches the source folder
- Add a hide navigation button for large desktops
- Search through the navigation
  (probably with a custom search index via configuration file)
- Numbered headings

## The name
